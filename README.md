<p>Reflection upon the project: Challenges and overcoming them, we believe, taught us a lot about patience, iOS, and software development.
It's an incredibly satisfying feeling to have an idea and see it come to life - yet humbling in that there's plenty of work to be done for the idea to be
fully realized. We successfully implemented all we had set out to accomplish by the due date for this course, and very proud of our work.
